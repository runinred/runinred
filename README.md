### Hey! 
I am Denis Ogloblin. 

Ex- service analyst in Miele CIS. 
My main focus is the analysis of inventories and the sales structure of spare parts for household and professional appliances. 

My stack: Python (pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, plotly, scipy, sklearn, folium, requests) SQL, PostgreSQL, MS Excel, Power Query, DAX, Power BI, Tableau. 


I am currently studying at Yandex Practicum, where I am improving my skills in data analysis.
I am actively studying and applying
- SQL, which I use to extract and manipulate data in databases,
- Python, as it provides a powerful tool for data processing and analysis,
- BI systems (for example, Tableau) that help visualize and interpret data for data-driven decisions .

My GitHub repository contains projects related to data analysis, as well as examples of my research and analytical reports.

I am always open to collaboration and sharing experiences with other analysts and developers. 
I will be glad to share my knowledge and learn from other professionals.
